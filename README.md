Assumptions or Decisions Made During Development Base Image: Chose the official Node.js image as the base image for simplicity and compatibility. Dependency Management: Used npm for managing dependencies as it's commonly used in the Node.js ecosystem. Exposing Port: Assumed the application runs on port 8081 by default, but this can be adjusted as needed. Start Command: Assumed the start command specified in package.json is npm start, which is common for Node.js applications.
